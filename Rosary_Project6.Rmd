Data Analytics in Retail sector can enhance operations and increase sales. It can also help the business to optimize pricing by analysing competitive pricing and discount strategies(Barash R,2019).Few applications of bid data analytics in retail industry include: Optimized staffing through data collected from local events and shopping patterns, Fraud reduction and Timely Inventory analysis(Hooda S,2021).
<p>
The data set used in this report contains details about global sales of a store company in 2020.There are word-wide customers(from Australia, Argentia, Canada, United States of America, United Kingdom, etc ) who purchased products from the store company.There are three categories under department i.e., Furniture, Office supplies and Technology which are further classified into sub-categories(Division) like Accessories, Phones, Paper,Furnishings,etc.
<P>
The data set contains numerical variables like price, total sales, quantity, total sales and shipping cost, etc and categorical variables like Market, Segment, Department and division, etc.
The sales and profits of the company are included in the data set where Samsung smart phones under Technology department had the maximum sales of (29,300 USD approx.) recorded in LATAM, South America and the least sales($350 USD approx.) was recorded by BCardinal Poly Divider Pockets for Ring Binders under Office Supplies department.
In Africa, more number of BIC Canvas(17 approx.) under Art department were sold making it the maximum number of products sold in 2020.
<P>
One of the advantages of using Analytics is that statistical measures can be easily recorded irrespective of the area of organizations being globe-wise.These statistical information can be collated and presented to the organization so that they can focus on areas where they may be missing and improve their sales focusing at the customer tendencies.
<P>
From the data set, we can recognize One discrepancy i.e.,Profit attribute in which there are negative values. The records containing negative profits also indicate losses occurred by sales of a particular product. We can focus on that area along with departments for instance, we can identify the kind of product that brings losses and at the same time we can come up with a solution to limit those losses and increase the profits of the business.
<P>
In this assignment, I will use Exploratory Data Analysis to understand and observe the variables in the data set. I will try to get familiar with the angles that can cause losses to the business.Data interpretation using statistical measures and data presentation using charts or graphs are used to support the analysis of the given problem. Hence, filtering out some factors influencing the losses incurred.
<P>
I will be using Rmarkdown, tables, ggplot, bar plot, histogram, box plot, pie chart and scatter plot to support the analysis.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Task 1: Descriptive statistics of five numerical variables. </B></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=3.5>I chose numerical variables Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit and Shipping Cost for which descriptive statistics(mean, median, Standard Deviation and Range) are calculated and presented in the below table.</FONT>

```{r Task1 To present descriptive statistics of the numerical variables I chose}
#Calculate descriptive statistics of numerical variables.
stat_mean=c(mean(sales2020$Sales_Total),mean(sales2020$Quantity),mean(sales2020$Discount),mean(sales2020$Profits),mean(sales2020$ShippingCost_Product))
stat_median=c(median(sales2020$Sales_Total),median(sales2020$Quantity),median(sales2020$Discount),median(sales2020$Profits),median(sales2020$ShippingCost_Product))

rownames(sales_matrix) <- c("Mean","Median","Standard Deviation","Range")
#The matrix is presented in a table format.
knitr::kable(sales_matrix)
```

<FONT SIZE=3.5><B>Observations:</B> We can infer that mean, median, standard deviation and range for sales is comparatively higher than other numerical variables that I chose.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Task 2: Comparison of numerical variables data using box plot and histogram. </B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR>The numerical variables that I chose in step 1 are presented parallel using a box plot and histogram.
<P><B>2.1 Box plot and histogram of numerical variable total sales.</B>
</FONT>

```{r Task 2.1 Boxplot and histogram of variable total sales}
#Present a box plot of total sales
par(mfcol=c(1,2),mai=c(1.6,1,0.4,2),mar=c(6.5, 6.5, 3, 4))
totsl_bar=boxplot(sales2020$Sales_Total,
        main="Box plot of total sales in sales2020",
        cex.main=1,
        xlab="Total Sales",
        col=brewer.pal(4,"PRGn"),
        las=1)
#Present a histogram of total sales
totsl_hist=hist(sales2020$Sales_Total,
        main="Histogram of total sales in sales2020",

        ylab="Frequency",
        col=brewer.pal(8,"PuRd"),
        breaks=15)
```
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR>The above boxplot and histogram depict that majority of the total sales(more than 75%) lies within 0 and 5000 and we can also observe that less sales lies between 10,000 and 30,000 approximately.

<P>
<BR><B>2.2 Boxplot and histogram of numerical variable Quantity.</B>
</FONT>
```{r Task 2.2 Boxplot and histogram of variable Quantity}

        ylim=c(0,250),
        col=brewer.pal(8,"PuRd"),
        breaks=15)
```
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR>The above boxplot and histogram depict that 75% of quantity lies within 3 to 8 approximately and there are outliers(data points that lie at an abnormal distance from other values in the distribution) present in the distribution.This distribution is skewed right since majority of data points lie above the median.

<P>
<BR><B>2.3 Boxplot and histogram of numerical variable Discounts.</B>
</FONT>
```{r Task 2.3 Boxplot and histogram of variable Discounts}
#Present a box plot of all discounts
par(mfcol=c(1,2),mai=c(1.6,1,0.4,6),mar=c(6.5, 6.5, 3, 3.5))
disc_bar=boxplot(sales2020$Discount,
        main="Box plot of discounts in sales2020",
        cex.main=1,
        xlab="Discount",

        col=brewer.pal(8,"PuRd"),
        breaks=15)
```
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR>It occurs to be a different scenario while presenting discounts. The above histogram depicts that products that have 0.0% discount are around 250 approx.From the box plot, we can depict that half(50%) of the products had discounts less than 10%.Also, the maximum discount given was 30%.

<P>
<BR><B>2.4 Box plot and histogram of numerical variable Profits.</B>
</FONT>

```{r Task 2.4 Boxplot and histogram of variable Profits}
#Present a box plot of all profits

        breaks=10)
```
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR> The above histogram and boxplot depicts that the majority of profit lie between 0 to 2000 approximately. Also, we can observe that there are negative values in the histogram indicating negative profits.We can focus on those products which attain negative profits for improving sales of the business.


<BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Task 3: Count and present categorical variable groups. </B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR>The categorical variables I chose to group are: Market, Segment, Department and Division. The observations of each category are grouped(count is calculated with the observations of each category) using a table and presented.
<P>
<BR><B>3.1 Total Observations on categorical variable Market .</B>
</FONT>
```{r Task 3.1 To count the observations of market and present it using a bar graph}
#Get the count of observations using table command
mkt_tab <- table(sales2020$Market)

<BR>In this task, I will be combining three categorical and numerical variables. A suitable question combining a categorical and a numerical variable will be asked for which statistical interpretation will be performed and presented via a graph. 
<P>
<BR><B>4.1 What is the total quantity per division?.</B>
<BR> In this task, we need to calculate the total number of quantities sold per division using tapply() function. Then, a bar plot is presented with the obtained results.

<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR><B>Observations:</B> From the above bar plot, we can see that maximum number of products(count=835) ordered in 2020 is Chairs whereas the least number of products ordered was Labels. Phones and storage almost has the same quantity of products ordered.
<P>
<BR><B>4.2 What is the average sales per market?.</B>
<BR> In this task, we need to calculate the mean of sales grouped by each market using tapply() function. Then, a dot plot is presented with the obtained results.
</FONT>
```{r Task 4.2 Average sales per division ,warning=FALSE}

<FONT SIZE=3.5>
<BR> The open question I chose is what is the impact of profits on every market or comparison of profits across markets. Market is a categorical variable and Profits is a numerical variable. The approach here is to compare the profits of each and every market using box plots.
</FONT>
```{r Task 6 Comaprision of profits across each market}

<LI>Asia Pacific, Europe and LATAM contain negative profits and We can focus on these products producing negative profits to increase profits.
<LI>While comparing markets, Europe has the highest profit value and more than 75% of the profits lie below 2000.
<LI>The profits distribution in LATAM and USCA are symmetrical since the median and median are almost same in both the distributions.
<LI>The outliers i.e.,values present away from the distribution are present in every market except Africa.
<LI>The interquartile range(distance between the quartiles in boxplot) for USCA is comparatively less when compared to other markets.

<BR><FONT SIZE=5, COLOR="#9e1306"><B>Conclusion</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3.5>
This project helped me gain a keen understanding on how to analyze, interpret and present data. Working with a real time data set, I gained exposure on how to handle data and form my own questions from it. Also, performing these descriptive statistical tasks enhanced my expertise level in R even more. 
<BR>Visualizations using ggplot(),boxplot(),barplot() and hist(),etc. are extremely useful to understand the relationship between each variable in the data set. Before every task, I asked questions like what are the outcomes of this task, how the data can be analyzed from the particular task and how it would enhance the business methods.Asking these questions made it easier for me.
<BR> Thus, I was able to analyze patterns from the huge data set and I understood that it can be used to predict revenues, increase in sales, profit/loss, etc. that can enhance businesses in a positive direction.
